## Weekly Exchange Sessions
We have weekly sessions (Mondays, 1-2pm PT) where invited speakers will present their work or a journal club paper followed by an interactive discussion and Q&A among all participants. Sessions will be recorded or livestreamed based on presenters' consent and the recordings will be available for viewership later.

## Timings
The talks will be held **every week** from **1pm-2pm PT** on **Mondays**. You can subscribe to our [public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=ab4c643a609c1c1e417badd79027697d716f7bed093114f274c72a8100aafcf6@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles).
