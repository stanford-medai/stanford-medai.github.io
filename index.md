# MedAI: Forum for Medical AI & Imaging

Machine learning and deep networks are transforming the field of medicine in exciting yet hitherto unknown ways, all the way from diagnosis to treatment. However, their applicability is still limited. How can we effectively combine the strengths of AI with the knowledge and experience of trained physicians? How can we ensure clinical deployment and adoption? 

As AI researchers in this field, our goal is to foster communication - we want our forum to be a place where we can critically examine key topics in AI and medicine, generate fresh ideas and discussion around their intersection and most importantly, learn from each other.

One of the main strengths of our forum would be to foster collaboration across institutions and increase networking. 

Currently, three AI groups on healthcare informatics are participating in this forum with distinct background and expertise: 
- [Rubin Lab](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu) (**Stanford University**)
- [Banerjee Lab](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/imon-banerjee-stanford/home?authuser=0) (**Emory University**) - [Summers Lab](https://www.cc.nih.gov/meet-our-doctors/rsummers.html) (**National Institute of Health (NIH)**)

We will be having weekly sessions (**Thursdays, 1-2pm PST**, starting **April 1st, 2021**) where invited speakers will give a talk presenting their work followed by an interactive discussion and Q&A. All sessions will be recorded and the recordings will be available for viewership later. Check out our [About]({{ 'about' | relative_url}}) page for more details.
