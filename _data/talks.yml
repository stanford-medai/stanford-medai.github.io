  title: Equitable Valuation of Data
  abstract: As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this talk, we discuss a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on a number of data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We introduce Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. We then briefly discuss the notion of distributional Shapley, where the value of a point is defined in the context of underlying data distribution.

  title: Federated Learning with FOMO for Personalized Training and Deployment
  abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an exciting and relatively new deep learning framework that canonically trains a single global model across decentralized local datasets maintained by participating clients. Accordingly with respect to making deep learning more deployable, FL is particularly promising in real world settings where technological or privacy constraints prevent individual data from being aggregated together. However, one model may not always be optimal for all participating clients. From healthcare to recommendation systems, we would ideally like to learn and deliver a personalized model for each participating client, as data may not be identically distributed from one client to another. This problem is emphasized when we consider how we might deploy FL in practice, where individual clients may only choose to federate if they can guarantee a benefit from the model produced at the end.<br><br>In this talk, I will present some recent work on one solution, called FedFomo, where each client effectively only federates with other relevant clients to obtain stronger personalization. First we will review federated learning as a machine learning framework, emphasizing the motivations behind personalized FL. I will then go into the origin story of FedFomo's name, highlighting a simple yet effective approach based both on the "fear of missing out" and "first order model optimization". In tandem, these ideas describe how FedFomo can efficiently figure out how much each client can benefit from another's locally trained model, and then use these values to calculate optimal federated models for each client. Critically, this does not assume knowledge of any underlying data distributions or client similarities, as this information is often not known apriori. Finally, I will describe recent empirical results on FedFomo's promising performance on a variety of federated settings, datasets, and degrees of local data heterogeneity, leading to wider discussion on the future directions and impact of federated learning and distributed machine learning, when personalization is in the picture.
  bio: Michael Zhang is a Computer Science PhD Student at Stanford, currently working with Chris Ré and Chelsea Finn. He is broadly interested in making machine learning more deployable and reliable in the "real world", especially through the lenses of improving model robustness and personalization to distribution shifts and new tasks, as well as developing new systems that enable collaborative machine learning and/or learning with less labels.

  title: Weakly Supervised Learning in Medicine (Better Living through Programmatic Supervision)
  abstract: The high cost of building labeled training sets is one of the largest barriers to using supervised machine learning in medicine. Privacy concerns create additional challenges to sharing training data for modalities like patient notes, making it difficult to train state-of-the-art NLP tools for analyzing electronic health records. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for faster, more systematic methods of curating and sharing training data. One promising approach is weakly supervised learning, where low cost and often noisy label sources are combined to programmatically generate labeled training data for commodity deep learning architectures such as BERT. Programmatic labeling takes a data-centric view of machine learning and provides many of the same practical benefits as software development, including better consistency, inspectability, and creating higher-level abstractions for experts to inject domain knowledge into machine learning models.<br><br>In this talk I outline our new framework for weakly supervised clinical entity recognition, Trove, which builds training data by combining multiple public medical ontologies and other imperfect label sources. Instead of manually labeling data, in Trove annotators focus on defining labelers using ontology-based properties like semantic types as well as optional task-specific rules. On four named entity benchmark tasks, Trove approaches the performance of models trained using hand-labeled data. However unlike hand-labeled data, our labelers can be shared and modified without compromising patient privacy.
