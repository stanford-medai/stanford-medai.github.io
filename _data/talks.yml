  title: Equitable Valuation of Data
  abstract: As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this talk, we discuss a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on a number of data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We introduce Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. We then briefly discuss the notion of distributional Shapley, where the value of a point is defined in the context of underlying data distribution.

  title: Federated Learning with FOMO for Personalized Training and Deployment
  abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an exciting and relatively new deep learning framework that canonically trains a single global model across decentralized local datasets maintained by participating clients. Accordingly with respect to making deep learning more deployable, FL is particularly promising in real world settings where technological or privacy constraints prevent individual data from being aggregated together. However, one model may not always be optimal for all participating clients. From healthcare to recommendation systems, we would ideally like to learn and deliver a personalized model for each participating client, as data may not be identically distributed from one client to another. This problem is emphasized when we consider how we might deploy FL in practice, where individual clients may only choose to federate if they can guarantee a benefit from the model produced at the end.<br><br>In this talk, I will present some recent work on one solution, called FedFomo, where each client effectively only federates with other relevant clients to obtain stronger personalization. First we will review federated learning as a machine learning framework, emphasizing the motivations behind personalized FL. I will then go into the origin story of FedFomo's name, highlighting a simple yet effective approach based both on the "fear of missing out" and "first order model optimization". In tandem, these ideas describe how FedFomo can efficiently figure out how much each client can benefit from another's locally trained model, and then use these values to calculate optimal federated models for each client. Critically, this does not assume knowledge of any underlying data distributions or client similarities, as this information is often not known apriori. Finally, I will describe recent empirical results on FedFomo's promising performance on a variety of federated settings, datasets, and degrees of local data heterogeneity, leading to wider discussion on the future directions and impact of federated learning and distributed machine learning, when personalization is in the picture.

  title: Weakly Supervised Learning in Medicine (Better Living through Programmatic Supervision)
  abstract: The high cost of building labeled training sets is one of the largest barriers to using supervised machine learning in medicine. Privacy concerns create additional challenges to sharing training data for modalities like patient notes, making it difficult to train state-of-the-art NLP tools for analyzing electronic health records. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for faster, more systematic methods of curating and sharing training data. One promising approach is weakly supervised learning, where low cost and often noisy label sources are combined to programmatically generate labeled training data for commodity deep learning architectures such as BERT. Programmatic labeling takes a data-centric view of machine learning and provides many of the same practical benefits as software development, including better consistency, inspectability, and creating higher-level abstractions for experts to inject domain knowledge into machine learning models.<br><br>In this talk I outline our new framework for weakly supervised clinical entity recognition, Trove, which builds training data by combining multiple public medical ontologies and other imperfect label sources. Instead of manually labeling data, in Trove annotators focus on defining labelers using ontology-based properties like semantic types as well as optional task-specific rules. On four named entity benchmark tasks, Trove approaches the performance of models trained using hand-labeled data. However unlike hand-labeled data, our labelers can be shared and modified without compromising patient privacy.

  title: Understanding Scanner Utilization with Real-Time DICOM Metadata Extraction
  abstract: Understanding system performance metrics ensures better utilization of the radiology resources with more targeted interventions. The images produced by radiology scanners typically follow the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard format. The DICOM images consist of textual metadata that can be used to calculate key timing parameters, such as the exact study durations and scanner utilization. However, hospital networks lack the resources and capabilities to extract the metadata from the images quickly and automatically compute the scanner utilization properties. Thus, they resort to using data records from the Radiology Information Systems (RIS). However, data acquired from RIS are prone to human errors, rendering many derived key performance metrics inadequate and inaccurate. Hence, there is motivation to establish a real-time image transfer from the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to receive the DICOM images from the scanners to research clusters to conduct such metadata processing to evaluate scanner utilization metrics efficiently and quickly.<br><br>In this talk, we present Niffler (https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler), an open-source DICOM Framework for Machine Learning Pipelines and Processing Workflows. Niffler analyzes the scanners' utilization as a real-time monitoring framework that retrieves radiology images into a research cluster using the DICOM networking protocol and then extracts and processes the metadata from the images. Niffler facilitates a better understanding of scanner utilization across a vast healthcare network by observing properties such as study duration, the interval between the encounters, and the series count of studies. Benchmarks against using the RIS data indicate that our proposed framework based on real-time PACS data estimates the scanner utilization more accurately. Our framework has been running stable and supporting several machine learning workflows for more than two years on our extensive healthcare network in pseudo-real-time. We further present how we use the Niffler framework for real-time and on-demand execution of machine learning (ML) pipelines on radiology images.

  title: Gifsplanation via Latent Shift - A Simple Autoencoder Approach to Counterfactual Generation for Chest X-rays
  abstract: <strong>Motivation</strong> Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. <br><strong>Specific problem</strong> A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption.<br><strong>Our approach</strong> Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. This work will be presented at MIDL 2021.<br><strong>Results</strong> We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features.We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15±0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04±1.06 with p=0.57).<br><strong>Project Page</strong> https://mlmed.org/gifsplanation/ <br><strong>Source code</strong> https://github.com/mlmed/gifsplanation

  title: Few-shot Chest X-ray Diagnosis Using Clinical Images and the Images from the Published Scientific Literature
  abstract: Few-shot learning is the art of machine learning that tries to mimic the human cognitive ability of understanding new object classes from a few labeled training examples. In the last few years, several few-shot learning methods have been proposed for different tasks related to natural images. However, few-shot learning is relatively unexplored in the field radiology image analysis. In this seminar, we will present two few-shot learning methods for chest x-ray diagnosis. Our first method uses a discriminative ensemble trained using labeled clinical chest x-ray images. The second method uses labeled chest x-ray images from the published scientific literature and unlabeled clinical chest x-ray images to train a machine learning model. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed methods over several existing few-shot learning methods.

  title: Segmentation and Quantification of Breast Arterial Calcifications (BAC) on Mammograms
  abstract: Measurements of breast arterial calcifications (BAC) can offer a personalized, noninvasive approach to risk-stratify women for cardiovascular disease such as heart attack and stroke. We aim to detect and segment breast arterial calcifications in mammograms accurately and suggest novel measurements to quantify detected BAC for future clinical applications. To separate BAC in mammograms, we propose a lightweight fine vessel segmentation method Simple Context U-Net (SCU-Net). To further quantify calcifications, we test five quantitative metrics to inspect the progression of BAC for subjects- Sum of Mask Probability Metric (PM), Sum of Mask Area Metric (AM), Sum of Mask Intensity Metric (SIM), Sum of Mask Area with Threshold Intensity Metric (TAMx) and Sum of Mask Intensity with Threshold X Metric (TSIMx). Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the metrics to longitudinally measure calcifications in a group of 26 subjects and evaluate our quantification metrics compared to calcified voxels and calcium mass on breast CT for 10 subjects.

  title: Self-supervision & Contrastive Frameworks -- a vision-based review
  abstract: Self-supervised representation learning and contrastive techniques have picked up a lot interest in the last couple of years, especially in computer vision. Until recently, deep learning's successes thus far have been associated with a supervised learning paradigm, wherein labelled datasets are used to train models on specific tasks. This need for labelled datasets has been identified as the bottleneck for scaling deep learning models across various tasks and domains. They rely heavily on costly, time-consuming dataset curation and labelling schemes. <br><br>Self-supervision allows us to learn representations from large unlabelled datasets. Instead of relying on labels for inputs, it depends on designing suitable pre-text tasks to generate pseudo-labels from the data directly. Contrastive learning refers to a special subset of these self-supervised methods that have achieved the most success recently. In this talk, I will go over the top 6 recent frameworks - SimCLR, MoCo V2, BYOL, SwAV, DINO and Barlow Twins, giving a deeper dive into their methodology & performance and comparing each of the frameworks' strengths and weaknesses and discuss their suitability for applications in the medical domain.

  title: Learning the Structure of EHR with Graph Convolutional Transformer
  abstract: Large-scale electronic health records (EHR) provide a great opportunity for learning representation of clinical entities (such as codes, visits, patients). As EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, their diverse information (diagnosis, medications, etc) can be naturally viewed as a graph. In this talk, we will study how this graphical structure can be exploited, or even learned for supervised prediction tasks using a combination of graph convolution and self-attention. Additionally, we will briefly present more recent works regarding multi-modal learning using Transformers.

  title: Hydranet -- Data Augmentation for Regression Neural Networks
  abstract: Deep learning techniques are often criticized to heavily depend on a large quantity of labeled data. This problem is even more challenging in medical image analysis where the annotator expertise is often scarce. We propose a novel data-augmentation method to regularize neural network regressors that learn from a single global label per image. The principle of the method is to create new samples by recombining existing ones. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two tasks- estimation of the number of enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia, and estimation of white matter hyperintensities volume. We show that the proposed method improves the performance over more basic data augmentation. The proposed method reached an intraclass correlation coefficient between ground truth and network predictions of 0.73 on the first task and 0.84 on the second task, only using between 25 and 30 scans with a single global label per scan for training. With the same number of training scans, more conventional data augmentation methods could only reach intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.68 on the first task, and 0.79 on the second task.

  title: βVAE Representation Learning and Explainability for Psychopathology with EEG and the constraints on deployment in the real world
  abstract: Despite extensive standardization, diagnostic interviews for mental health disorders encompass substantial subjective judgment. Previous studies have demonstrated that EEG-based neural measures can function as reliable objective correlates of depression, or even predictors of depression and its course. However, their clinical utility has not been fully realized because of 1) the lack of automated ways to deal with the inherent noise associated with EEG data at scale, and 2) the lack of knowledge of which aspects of the EEG signal may be markers of a clinical disorder. Here we adapt an unsupervised pipeline from the recent deep representation learning literature to address these problems by 1) learning a disentangled representation using β-VAE to denoise the signal, and 2) extracting interpretable features associated with a sparse set of clinical labels using a Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN). We demonstrate that our method is able to outperform the canonical hand-engineered baseline classification method on a number of factors, including participant age and depression diagnosis. Furthermore, our method recovers a representation that can be used to automatically extract denoised Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from novel, single EEG trajectories, and supports fast supervised re-mapping to various clinical labels, allowing clinicians to re-use a single EEG representation regardless of updates to the standardized diagnostic system. Finally, single factors of the learned disentangled representations often correspond to meaningful markers of clinical factors, as automatically detected by SCAN, allowing for human interpretability and post-hoc expert analysis of the recommendations made by the model.

  title: Learning domain-agnostic visual representation for computational pathology using medically-irrelevant style transfer augmentation
  abstract: Suboptimal generalization of machine learning models on unseen data is a key challenge which hampers the clinical applicability of such models to medical imaging. Although various methods such as domain adaptation and domain generalization have evolved to combat this challenge, learning robust and generalizable representations is core to medical image understanding, and continues to be a problem. Here, we propose STRAP (Style TRansfer Augmentation for histoPathology), a form of data augmentation based on random style transfer from non-medical style source such as artistic paintings, for learning domain-agnostic visual representations in computational pathology. Style transfer replaces the low-level texture content of an image with the uninformative style of randomly selected style source image, while preserving the original high-level semantic content. This improves robustness to domain shift and can be used as a simple yet powerful tool for learning domain-agnostic representations. We demonstrate that STRAP leads to state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts, on two particular classification tasks in computational pathology.

  title: Rethinking Architecture Design for Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning
  abstract: Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm enabling collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations while keeping data private at each institution. Despite recent progress, there remain fundamental challenges such as lack of convergence and potential for catastrophic forgetting in federated learning across real-world heterogeneous devices. While most research efforts focus on improving the optimization process in FL, in this talk, we will provide a new perspective by rethinking the choice of architectures in federated models. We will show that simply replacing convolutional networks with Transformers can greatly reduce catastrophic forgetting of previous devices, accelerate convergence, and reach a better global model, especially when dealing with heterogeneous data. The code related to this talk is released <a href="https://github.com/Liangqiong/ViT-FL-main">here</a>, to encourage future exploration in robust architectures as an alternative to current research efforts on the optimization front.

  title: Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Representation Learning in Graphs
  abstract: Self-supervised graph representation learning aims to construct meaningful representations of graph-structured data in the absence of labels. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on contrastive learning, and depend heavily on the construction of augmentations and negative examples. Achieving peak performance requires computation quadratic in the number of nodes, which can be prohibitively expensive. In this talk, we will present Bootstrapped Graph Latents (BGRL) a method for self-supervised graph representation learning that gets rid of this potentially quadratic bottleneck. We show that BGRL outperforms or matches previous methods on several established benchmark datasets, while consuming 2-10x less memory. Moreover, it enables the effective usage of more expressive GNN architectures, allowing us to further improve the state of the art. Finally, we will present our recent results on applying BGRL to the very large-scale data regime, in the OGB-LSC KDD Cup, where it was key to our entry being among the top 3 awardees our track.

  title: Mandoline - Model Evaluation under Distribution Shift
  abstract: Machine learning models are often deployed in different settings than they were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to predict how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If an unlabeled sample from the target distribution is available, along with a labeled sample from a possibly different source distribution, standard approaches such as importance weighting can be applied to estimate performance on the target. However, importance weighting struggles when the source and target distributions have non-overlapping support or are high-dimensional. Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology and polling, we develop Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these issues. Our key insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the ways in which the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple "slicing functions" - noisy, potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible axes of distribution shift - to compute reweighted performance estimates. We further describe a density ratio estimation framework for the slices and show how its estimation error scales with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical validation on NLP and vision tasks shows that Mandoline can estimate performance on the target distribution up to 3x more accurately compared to standard baselines.<br>This is joint work done with equal contribution from Karan Goel and Nimit Sohoni, as well as Fait Poms, Kayvon Fatahalian, and Christopher Ré. In this talk I will also connect the Mandoline framework to the broader theme of interactive ML systems and some of my collaborators research in this area.

  title: Multimodal opportunistic risk assessment for ischemic heart disease
  abstract: Current risk scores for predicting ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk—the leading cause of global mortality—have limited efficacy. While body composition (BC) imaging biomarkers derived from abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) correlate with IHD risk, they are impractical to measure manually. Here, in a retrospective cohort of 8,197 contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT examinations undergoing up to 5 years of follow-up, we developed improved multimodal opportunistic risk assessment models for IHD by automatically extracting BC features from abdominal CT images and integrating these with features from each patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). Our predictive methods match and, in some cases, outperform clinical risk scores currently used in IHD risk assessment. We provide clinical interpretability of our model using a new method of determining tissue-level contributions from CT along with weightings of EMR features contributing to IHD risk. We conclude that such a multimodal approach, which automatically integrates BC biomarkers and EMR data can enhance IHD risk assessment and aid primary prevention efforts for IHD. In this talk, I will also go over other recent publications related to opportunistic imaging, body composition analysis and cardiovascular disease.

  title: Self-training vs. Weak Supervision using Untrained Neural Nets for MR Reconstruction
  abstract: Untrained neural networks use CNN architecture itself as an image prior for reconstructing natural images without requiring any supervised training data. This makes them a compelling tool for solving inverse problems such as denoising and MR reconstruction for which they achieve performance that is on-par with some state-of-the-art supervised methods. However, untrained neural networks require tens of minutes to reconstruct a single MR slice at inference time, making them impractical for clinical deployment. We propose using ConvDecoder to generate “weakly-labeled” data from undersampled MR scans at training time. Using few supervised pairs and constructed weakly supervised pairs, we train an unrolled neural network that gives strong reconstruction performance with fast inference time of few seconds. We show that our method considerably improves over supervised and self-training baselines in the limited data regime while mitigating the slow inference bottleneck of untrained neural networks. In this talk, I will also briefly talk about how self-training can be applied, and in fact be complementary to pre-training approaches, in other application domains such as natural language understanding.

  title: The Many Faces of Weak Supervision in Medical Representation Learning - Harnessing Cross-Modality, Enabling Multi-task Learning, and Mitigating Hidden Stratification
  abstract: Weakly supervised machine learning models have shown substantial promise in unlocking the value of vast stores of medical information in support of clinical decisionmaking.  In this talk, we will discuss several avenues by which these approaches can be used in real-world medical imaging applications, and the value that can be provided in each case.  We first demonstrate how cross-modal weak supervision can be used to train models that achieve results statistically similar to those trained using hand labels, but with orders-of-magnitude less labeling effort.  We then build on this idea to show how the large-scale multi-task learning made practical by weak supervision can provide value by supporting anatomically-resoved models for volumetric medical imaging applications.  Finally, we discuss recent results indicating that weakly supervised distributionally robust optimization can be used to improve model robustness in an automated way.

  title: Explainable AI - from generalities to time series
  abstract: Modern machine learning models are complicated. They typically involve millions of operations to turn their input into a prediction. Hence, in a human perspective, they are complete black-boxes. When these models are used in critical areas such as medicine, finance and the criminal justice system, this lack of transparency appears as a major hindrance to their adoption. With the necessity to address this problem, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) thrived. In this talk, we will first illustrate how XAI allows to achieve a better understanding of these complex machine learning models in general. We will then focus on model for time series data, which constitutes a big portion of the medical data.

  title: Observational Supervision for Medical Image Classification using Gaze Data
  abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated favorable performance on many medical image classification tasks. However, they rely on expensive hand-labeled datasets that are time-consuming to create. In this work, we explore a new supervision source to training deep learning models by using gaze data that is passively and cheaply collected during clinical workflow. We focus on three medical imaging tasks, including classifying chest X-ray scans for pneumothorax and brain MRI slices for metastasis, two of which we curated gaze data for. The gaze data consists of a sequence of fixation locations on the image from an expert trying to identify an abnormality. Hence, the gaze data contains rich information about the image that can be used as a powerful supervision source. We first identify a set of gaze features and show that they indeed contain class discriminative information. Then, we propose two methods for incorporating gaze features into deep learning pipelines. When no task labels are available, we combine multiple gaze features to extract weak labels and use them as the sole source of supervision (Gaze-WS). When task labels are available, we propose to use the gaze features as auxiliary task labels in a multi-task learning framework (Gaze-MTL).

  title: Training medical image segmentation models with less labeled data
  abstract: Segmentation is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of medical images. Because manual segmentation can be tedious, be time consuming, and have high inter-observer variability, neural networks (NNs) are an appealing solution for automating the segmentation process. However, most approaches to training segmentation NNs rely on large, labeled training datasets that are costly to curate. In this work, we present a general semi-supervised method for training segmentation networks that reduces the required amount of labeled data. Instead, we rely on a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data for training. We evaluate our method on four cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) segmentation targets and show that by using only 100 labeled training image slices---up to a 99.4% reduction of labeled data---the proposed model achieves within 1.10% of the Dice coefficient achieved by a network trained with over 16,000 labeled image slices. We use the segmentations predicted by our method to derive cardiac functional biomarkers and find strong agreement to expert measurements of predicted ejection fraction, end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, or left ventricular mass compared an expert annotator.

  title: Towards Generalist Medical Imaging AI Using Multimodal Self-supervised Learning
  abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to human physicians in several medical domains and imaging modalities. While deep learning and computer vision provide promising solutions for automating medical image analysis, annotating medical imaging datasets requires domain expertise and is cost-prohibitive at scale. Therefore, the task of building effective medical imaging models is often hindered by the lack of large-scale manually labeled datasets. In a healthcare system where myriad opportunities and possibilities for automation exist, it is practically impossible to curate labeled datasets for all tasks, modalities, and outcomes for training supervised models. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies for training generalist medical AI models without the need for large-scale labeled datasets. In this talk, I will talk about how our group plan to develop generalist medical imaging models by combining multimodal fusion techniques with self-supervised learning.

  title: Assignment Control Plots - A Visual Companion for Causal Inference Study Design
  abstract:  An important step for any causal inference study design is understanding the distribution of the treated and untreated subjects in terms of measured baseline covariates.  However, not all baseline variation is equally important.  In the observational context, balancing on baseline variation summarized in a propensity score can help reduce bias due to self-selection. In both observational and experimental studies, controlling baseline variation associated with the expected outcomes can help increase the precision of causal effect estimates. We propose a set of visualizations that decompose the space of measured covariates into the different types of baseline variation important to the study design.  These assignment-control plots and variations thereof visually illustrate core concepts of causal inference and suggest new directions for methodological research on study design. As a practical demonstration, we illustrate one application of assignment-control plots to a study of cardiothoracic surgery. While the family of visualization tools for studies of causality is relatively sparse, simple visual tools can be an asset to education, application, and methods development.

  title: Adversarial debiasing with partial learning - medical image case-studies
  abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has become a very active research area in the last few years. While significant progress has been made in image classification tasks, only a few AI methods are actually being deployed in hospitals. A major hurdle in actively using clinical AI models currently is the trustworthiness of these models. When scrutinized, these models reveal implicit biases during the decision making, such as detecting race, ethnic groups, and subpopulations. These biases result in poor model performance, or racial disparity, for patients in these minority groups. In our ongoing study, we develop a two-step adversarial debiasing approach with partial learning that can reduce the racial disparity while preserving the performance of the targeted task. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on two independent medical image case-studies - chest X-ray and mammograms, and showed promises in reducing racial disparity while preserving the performance.

  title: Medical Image Analysis and Reconstruction with Data-efficient Learning
  abstract: Medical imaging is a critical step in modern healthcare procedures. Accurate interpretation of medical images, e.g., CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and histology images, plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis, assessment, and therapy. While deep learning provides an avenue to deliver automated medical image analysis and reconstruction via data-driven representation learning, the success is largely attributed to the massive datasets with abundant annotations. However, collecting and labeling such large-scaled dataset is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. In this talk, I will present our recent works on building data-efficient learning systems for medical image analysis and reconstruction, such as computer-aided diagnosis, anatomical structure segmentation, and CT reconstruction. The proposed methods cover a wide range of deep learning and machine learning topics, including semi-supervised learning, multi-modality learning, multi-task learning, integrating domain knowledge, etc. The up-to-date progress and promising future directions will also be discussed.

  title: Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Medical Image Synthesis, Translation, and Augmentation
  abstract: Medical imaging is a source of crucial information in modern healthcare. Deep learning models have been developed for various modalities such as CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and PET for automatic or semi-automatic diagnosis or assessment of diseases. While deep learning models have been proven to be very powerful, training such models sufficiently requires large, well-annotated but expensive datasets. However, medical images, especially those containing diseases, are rare. While there are a variety of solutions to improve models with limited and imbalanced datasets, one solution is generating these rare images through generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this presentation, I will present a quick review on the use of GANs in medical imaging tasks, specifically classification and segmentation. Then I will present and discuss our recent work on using GANs for generating synthetic dual energy CT (sDECT) from single energy CT (SECT). Finally, some interesting challenges and possible future directions of GANs in medical imaging will be discussed.

  title: Towards Unsupervised Biomedical Image Segmentation using Hyperbolic Representations
  abstract: Segmentation models are extremely useful for biomedical image analysis, but training segmentation models often require large, labelled datasets that are difficult and costly to acquire. Unsupervised learning is a promising approach for training segmentation models that avoids the need to acquire labelled datasets, but is made difficult by the lack of high-quality supervisory signal from expert annotations. Using the observation that biomedical images often contain an inherent hierarchical structure, we augment a VAE with additional supervisory signal via a novel self-supervised hierarchical loss. To aid the learning of hierarchical structure, we learn hyperbolic representations instead of Euclidean representations. Hyperbolic representations have previously been employed in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) as a way to learn hierarchical and tree-like structures, making them a natural choice of representation. In this talk, I will discuss hyperbolic representations for biomedical imaging as well as our recent paper on the topic.

  title: SegFormer - Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers
  abstract: We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features- 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code is available <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer">here</a>.
