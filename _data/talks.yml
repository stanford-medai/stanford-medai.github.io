  title: Equitable Valuation of Data
  abstract: As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this talk, we discuss a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on a number of data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We introduce Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. We then briefly discuss the notion of distributional Shapley, where the value of a point is defined in the context of underlying data distribution.

  title: Federated Learning with FOMO for Personalized Training and Deployment
  abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an exciting and relatively new deep learning framework that canonically trains a single global model across decentralized local datasets maintained by participating clients. Accordingly with respect to making deep learning more deployable, FL is particularly promising in real world settings where technological or privacy constraints prevent individual data from being aggregated together. However, one model may not always be optimal for all participating clients. From healthcare to recommendation systems, we would ideally like to learn and deliver a personalized model for each participating client, as data may not be identically distributed from one client to another. This problem is emphasized when we consider how we might deploy FL in practice, where individual clients may only choose to federate if they can guarantee a benefit from the model produced at the end.<br><br>In this talk, I will present some recent work on one solution, called FedFomo, where each client effectively only federates with other relevant clients to obtain stronger personalization. First we will review federated learning as a machine learning framework, emphasizing the motivations behind personalized FL. I will then go into the origin story of FedFomo's name, highlighting a simple yet effective approach based both on the "fear of missing out" and "first order model optimization". In tandem, these ideas describe how FedFomo can efficiently figure out how much each client can benefit from another's locally trained model, and then use these values to calculate optimal federated models for each client. Critically, this does not assume knowledge of any underlying data distributions or client similarities, as this information is often not known apriori. Finally, I will describe recent empirical results on FedFomo's promising performance on a variety of federated settings, datasets, and degrees of local data heterogeneity, leading to wider discussion on the future directions and impact of federated learning and distributed machine learning, when personalization is in the picture.

  title: Weakly Supervised Learning in Medicine (Better Living through Programmatic Supervision)
  abstract: The high cost of building labeled training sets is one of the largest barriers to using supervised machine learning in medicine. Privacy concerns create additional challenges to sharing training data for modalities like patient notes, making it difficult to train state-of-the-art NLP tools for analyzing electronic health records. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for faster, more systematic methods of curating and sharing training data. One promising approach is weakly supervised learning, where low cost and often noisy label sources are combined to programmatically generate labeled training data for commodity deep learning architectures such as BERT. Programmatic labeling takes a data-centric view of machine learning and provides many of the same practical benefits as software development, including better consistency, inspectability, and creating higher-level abstractions for experts to inject domain knowledge into machine learning models.<br><br>In this talk I outline our new framework for weakly supervised clinical entity recognition, Trove, which builds training data by combining multiple public medical ontologies and other imperfect label sources. Instead of manually labeling data, in Trove annotators focus on defining labelers using ontology-based properties like semantic types as well as optional task-specific rules. On four named entity benchmark tasks, Trove approaches the performance of models trained using hand-labeled data. However unlike hand-labeled data, our labelers can be shared and modified without compromising patient privacy.

  title: Understanding Scanner Utilization with Real-Time DICOM Metadata Extraction
  abstract: Understanding system performance metrics ensures better utilization of the radiology resources with more targeted interventions. The images produced by radiology scanners typically follow the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard format. The DICOM images consist of textual metadata that can be used to calculate key timing parameters, such as the exact study durations and scanner utilization. However, hospital networks lack the resources and capabilities to extract the metadata from the images quickly and automatically compute the scanner utilization properties. Thus, they resort to using data records from the Radiology Information Systems (RIS). However, data acquired from RIS are prone to human errors, rendering many derived key performance metrics inadequate and inaccurate. Hence, there is motivation to establish a real-time image transfer from the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to receive the DICOM images from the scanners to research clusters to conduct such metadata processing to evaluate scanner utilization metrics efficiently and quickly.<br><br>In this talk, we present Niffler (https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler), an open-source DICOM Framework for Machine Learning Pipelines and Processing Workflows. Niffler analyzes the scanners' utilization as a real-time monitoring framework that retrieves radiology images into a research cluster using the DICOM networking protocol and then extracts and processes the metadata from the images. Niffler facilitates a better understanding of scanner utilization across a vast healthcare network by observing properties such as study duration, the interval between the encounters, and the series count of studies. Benchmarks against using the RIS data indicate that our proposed framework based on real-time PACS data estimates the scanner utilization more accurately. Our framework has been running stable and supporting several machine learning workflows for more than two years on our extensive healthcare network in pseudo-real-time. We further present how we use the Niffler framework for real-time and on-demand execution of machine learning (ML) pipelines on radiology images.

  title: Gifsplanation via Latent Shift - A Simple Autoencoder Approach to Counterfactual Generation for Chest X-rays
  abstract: <strong>Motivation</strong> Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. <br><strong>Specific problem</strong> A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption.<br><strong>Our approach</strong> Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. This work will be presented at MIDL 2021.<br><strong>Results</strong> We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features.We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15±0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04±1.06 with p=0.57).<br><strong>Project Page</strong> https://mlmed.org/gifsplanation/ <br><strong>Source code</strong> https://github.com/mlmed/gifsplanation

  title: Few-shot Chest X-ray Diagnosis Using Clinical Images and the Images from the Published Scientific Literature
  abstract: Few-shot learning is the art of machine learning that tries to mimic the human cognitive ability of understanding new object classes from a few labeled training examples. In the last few years, several few-shot learning methods have been proposed for different tasks related to natural images. However, few-shot learning is relatively unexplored in the field radiology image analysis. In this seminar, we will present two few-shot learning methods for chest x-ray diagnosis. Our first method uses a discriminative ensemble trained using labeled clinical chest x-ray images. The second method uses labeled chest x-ray images from the published scientific literature and unlabeled clinical chest x-ray images to train a machine learning model. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed methods over several existing few-shot learning methods.

  title: Segmentation and Quantification of Breast Arterial Calcifications (BAC) on Mammograms
  abstract: Measurements of breast arterial calcifications (BAC) can offer a personalized, noninvasive approach to risk-stratify women for cardiovascular disease such as heart attack and stroke. We aim to detect and segment breast arterial calcifications in mammograms accurately and suggest novel measurements to quantify detected BAC for future clinical applications. To separate BAC in mammograms, we propose a lightweight fine vessel segmentation method Simple Context U-Net (SCU-Net). To further quantify calcifications, we test five quantitative metrics to inspect the progression of BAC for subjects- Sum of Mask Probability Metric (PM), Sum of Mask Area Metric (AM), Sum of Mask Intensity Metric (SIM), Sum of Mask Area with Threshold Intensity Metric (TAMx) and Sum of Mask Intensity with Threshold X Metric (TSIMx). Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the metrics to longitudinally measure calcifications in a group of 26 subjects and evaluate our quantification metrics compared to calcified voxels and calcium mass on breast CT for 10 subjects.

  title: Self-supervision & Contrastive Frameworks -- a vision-based review
  abstract: Self-supervised representation learning and contrastive techniques have picked up a lot interest in the last couple of years, especially in computer vision. Until recently, deep learning's successes thus far have been associated with a supervised learning paradigm, wherein labelled datasets are used to train models on specific tasks. This need for labelled datasets has been identified as the bottleneck for scaling deep learning models across various tasks and domains. They rely heavily on costly, time-consuming dataset curation and labelling schemes. <br><br>Self-supervision allows us to learn representations from large unlabelled datasets. Instead of relying on labels for inputs, it depends on designing suitable pre-text tasks to generate pseudo-labels from the data directly. Contrastive learning refers to a special subset of these self-supervised methods that have achieved the most success recently. In this talk, I will go over the top 6 recent frameworks - SimCLR, MoCo V2, BYOL, SwAV, DINO and Barlow Twins, giving a deeper dive into their methodology & performance and comparing each of the frameworks' strengths and weaknesses and discuss their suitability for applications in the medical domain.

  title: Learning the Structure of EHR with Graph Convolutional Transformer
  abstract: Large-scale electronic health records (EHR) provide a great opportunity for learning representation of clinical entities (such as codes, visits, patients). As EHR data are typically stored in a relational database, their diverse information (diagnosis, medications, etc) can be naturally viewed as a graph. In this talk, we will study how this graphical structure can be exploited, or even learned for supervised prediction tasks using a combination of graph convolution and self-attention. Additionally, we will briefly present more recent works regarding multi-modal learning using Transformers.

  title: Hydranet -- Data Augmentation for Regression Neural Networks
  abstract: Deep learning techniques are often criticized to heavily depend on a large quantity of labeled data. This problem is even more challenging in medical image analysis where the annotator expertise is often scarce. We propose a novel data-augmentation method to regularize neural network regressors that learn from a single global label per image. The principle of the method is to create new samples by recombining existing ones. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two tasks- estimation of the number of enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia, and estimation of white matter hyperintensities volume. We show that the proposed method improves the performance over more basic data augmentation. The proposed method reached an intraclass correlation coefficient between ground truth and network predictions of 0.73 on the first task and 0.84 on the second task, only using between 25 and 30 scans with a single global label per scan for training. With the same number of training scans, more conventional data augmentation methods could only reach intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.68 on the first task, and 0.79 on the second task.

  title: βVAE Representation Learning and Explainability for Psychopathology with EEG and the constraints on deployment in the real world
  abstract: Despite extensive standardization, diagnostic interviews for mental health disorders encompass substantial subjective judgment. Previous studies have demonstrated that EEG-based neural measures can function as reliable objective correlates of depression, or even predictors of depression and its course. However, their clinical utility has not been fully realized because of 1) the lack of automated ways to deal with the inherent noise associated with EEG data at scale, and 2) the lack of knowledge of which aspects of the EEG signal may be markers of a clinical disorder. Here we adapt an unsupervised pipeline from the recent deep representation learning literature to address these problems by 1) learning a disentangled representation using β-VAE to denoise the signal, and 2) extracting interpretable features associated with a sparse set of clinical labels using a Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN). We demonstrate that our method is able to outperform the canonical hand-engineered baseline classification method on a number of factors, including participant age and depression diagnosis. Furthermore, our method recovers a representation that can be used to automatically extract denoised Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from novel, single EEG trajectories, and supports fast supervised re-mapping to various clinical labels, allowing clinicians to re-use a single EEG representation regardless of updates to the standardized diagnostic system. Finally, single factors of the learned disentangled representations often correspond to meaningful markers of clinical factors, as automatically detected by SCAN, allowing for human interpretability and post-hoc expert analysis of the recommendations made by the model.

  title: Learning domain-agnostic visual representation for computational pathology using medically-irrelevant style transfer augmentation
  abstract: Suboptimal generalization of machine learning models on unseen data is a key challenge which hampers the clinical applicability of such models to medical imaging. Although various methods such as domain adaptation and domain generalization have evolved to combat this challenge, learning robust and generalizable representations is core to medical image understanding, and continues to be a problem. Here, we propose STRAP (Style TRansfer Augmentation for histoPathology), a form of data augmentation based on random style transfer from non-medical style source such as artistic paintings, for learning domain-agnostic visual representations in computational pathology. Style transfer replaces the low-level texture content of an image with the uninformative style of randomly selected style source image, while preserving the original high-level semantic content. This improves robustness to domain shift and can be used as a simple yet powerful tool for learning domain-agnostic representations. We demonstrate that STRAP leads to state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts, on two particular classification tasks in computational pathology.

  title: Rethinking Architecture Design for Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning
  abstract: Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm enabling collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations while keeping data private at each institution. Despite recent progress, there remain fundamental challenges such as lack of convergence and potential for catastrophic forgetting in federated learning across real-world heterogeneous devices. While most research efforts focus on improving the optimization process in FL, in this talk, we will provide a new perspective by rethinking the choice of architectures in federated models. We will show that simply replacing convolutional networks with Transformers can greatly reduce catastrophic forgetting of previous devices, accelerate convergence, and reach a better global model, especially when dealing with heterogeneous data. The code related to this talk is released <a href="https://github.com/Liangqiong/ViT-FL-main">here</a>, to encourage future exploration in robust architectures as an alternative to current research efforts on the optimization front.

  title: Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Representation Learning in Graphs
  abstract: Self-supervised graph representation learning aims to construct meaningful representations of graph-structured data in the absence of labels. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on contrastive learning, and depend heavily on the construction of augmentations and negative examples. Achieving peak performance requires computation quadratic in the number of nodes, which can be prohibitively expensive. In this talk, we will present Bootstrapped Graph Latents (BGRL) a method for self-supervised graph representation learning that gets rid of this potentially quadratic bottleneck. We show that BGRL outperforms or matches previous methods on several established benchmark datasets, while consuming 2-10x less memory. Moreover, it enables the effective usage of more expressive GNN architectures, allowing us to further improve the state of the art. Finally, we will present our recent results on applying BGRL to the very large-scale data regime, in the OGB-LSC KDD Cup, where it was key to our entry being among the top 3 awardees our track.

  title: Mandoline - Model Evaluation under Distribution Shift
  abstract: Machine learning models are often deployed in different settings than they were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to predict how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If an unlabeled sample from the target distribution is available, along with a labeled sample from a possibly different source distribution, standard approaches such as importance weighting can be applied to estimate performance on the target. However, importance weighting struggles when the source and target distributions have non-overlapping support or are high-dimensional. Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology and polling, we develop Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these issues. Our key insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the ways in which the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple "slicing functions" - noisy, potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible axes of distribution shift - to compute reweighted performance estimates. We further describe a density ratio estimation framework for the slices and show how its estimation error scales with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical validation on NLP and vision tasks shows that Mandoline can estimate performance on the target distribution up to 3x more accurately compared to standard baselines.<br>This is joint work done with equal contribution from Karan Goel and Nimit Sohoni, as well as Fait Poms, Kayvon Fatahalian, and Christopher Ré. In this talk I will also connect the Mandoline framework to the broader theme of interactive ML systems and some of my collaborators research in this area.

  title: Multimodal opportunistic risk assessment for ischemic heart disease
  abstract: Current risk scores for predicting ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk—the leading cause of global mortality—have limited efficacy. While body composition (BC) imaging biomarkers derived from abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) correlate with IHD risk, they are impractical to measure manually. Here, in a retrospective cohort of 8,197 contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT examinations undergoing up to 5 years of follow-up, we developed improved multimodal opportunistic risk assessment models for IHD by automatically extracting BC features from abdominal CT images and integrating these with features from each patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). Our predictive methods match and, in some cases, outperform clinical risk scores currently used in IHD risk assessment. We provide clinical interpretability of our model using a new method of determining tissue-level contributions from CT along with weightings of EMR features contributing to IHD risk. We conclude that such a multimodal approach, which automatically integrates BC biomarkers and EMR data can enhance IHD risk assessment and aid primary prevention efforts for IHD. In this talk, I will also go over other recent publications related to opportunistic imaging, body composition analysis and cardiovascular disease.

  title: Self-training vs. Weak Supervision using Untrained Neural Nets for MR Reconstruction
  abstract: Untrained neural networks use CNN architecture itself as an image prior for reconstructing natural images without requiring any supervised training data. This makes them a compelling tool for solving inverse problems such as denoising and MR reconstruction for which they achieve performance that is on-par with some state-of-the-art supervised methods. However, untrained neural networks require tens of minutes to reconstruct a single MR slice at inference time, making them impractical for clinical deployment. We propose using ConvDecoder to generate “weakly-labeled” data from undersampled MR scans at training time. Using few supervised pairs and constructed weakly supervised pairs, we train an unrolled neural network that gives strong reconstruction performance with fast inference time of few seconds. We show that our method considerably improves over supervised and self-training baselines in the limited data regime while mitigating the slow inference bottleneck of untrained neural networks. In this talk, I will also briefly talk about how self-training can be applied, and in fact be complementary to pre-training approaches, in other application domains such as natural language understanding.

  title: The Many Faces of Weak Supervision in Medical Representation Learning - Harnessing Cross-Modality, Enabling Multi-task Learning, and Mitigating Hidden Stratification
  abstract: Weakly supervised machine learning models have shown substantial promise in unlocking the value of vast stores of medical information in support of clinical decisionmaking.  In this talk, we will discuss several avenues by which these approaches can be used in real-world medical imaging applications, and the value that can be provided in each case.  We first demonstrate how cross-modal weak supervision can be used to train models that achieve results statistically similar to those trained using hand labels, but with orders-of-magnitude less labeling effort.  We then build on this idea to show how the large-scale multi-task learning made practical by weak supervision can provide value by supporting anatomically-resoved models for volumetric medical imaging applications.  Finally, we discuss recent results indicating that weakly supervised distributionally robust optimization can be used to improve model robustness in an automated way.

  title: Explainable AI - from generalities to time series
  abstract: Modern machine learning models are complicated. They typically involve millions of operations to turn their input into a prediction. Hence, in a human perspective, they are complete black-boxes. When these models are used in critical areas such as medicine, finance and the criminal justice system, this lack of transparency appears as a major hindrance to their adoption. With the necessity to address this problem, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) thrived. In this talk, we will first illustrate how XAI allows to achieve a better understanding of these complex machine learning models in general. We will then focus on model for time series data, which constitutes a big portion of the medical data.

  title: Observational Supervision for Medical Image Classification using Gaze Data
  abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated favorable performance on many medical image classification tasks. However, they rely on expensive hand-labeled datasets that are time-consuming to create. In this work, we explore a new supervision source to training deep learning models by using gaze data that is passively and cheaply collected during clinical workflow. We focus on three medical imaging tasks, including classifying chest X-ray scans for pneumothorax and brain MRI slices for metastasis, two of which we curated gaze data for. The gaze data consists of a sequence of fixation locations on the image from an expert trying to identify an abnormality. Hence, the gaze data contains rich information about the image that can be used as a powerful supervision source. We first identify a set of gaze features and show that they indeed contain class discriminative information. Then, we propose two methods for incorporating gaze features into deep learning pipelines. When no task labels are available, we combine multiple gaze features to extract weak labels and use them as the sole source of supervision (Gaze-WS). When task labels are available, we propose to use the gaze features as auxiliary task labels in a multi-task learning framework (Gaze-MTL).

  title: Training medical image segmentation models with less labeled data
  abstract: Segmentation is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of medical images. Because manual segmentation can be tedious, be time consuming, and have high inter-observer variability, neural networks (NNs) are an appealing solution for automating the segmentation process. However, most approaches to training segmentation NNs rely on large, labeled training datasets that are costly to curate. In this work, we present a general semi-supervised method for training segmentation networks that reduces the required amount of labeled data. Instead, we rely on a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data for training. We evaluate our method on four cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) segmentation targets and show that by using only 100 labeled training image slices---up to a 99.4% reduction of labeled data---the proposed model achieves within 1.10% of the Dice coefficient achieved by a network trained with over 16,000 labeled image slices. We use the segmentations predicted by our method to derive cardiac functional biomarkers and find strong agreement to expert measurements of predicted ejection fraction, end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, or left ventricular mass compared an expert annotator.

  title: Towards Generalist Medical Imaging AI Using Multimodal Self-supervised Learning
  abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to human physicians in several medical domains and imaging modalities. While deep learning and computer vision provide promising solutions for automating medical image analysis, annotating medical imaging datasets requires domain expertise and is cost-prohibitive at scale. Therefore, the task of building effective medical imaging models is often hindered by the lack of large-scale manually labeled datasets. In a healthcare system where myriad opportunities and possibilities for automation exist, it is practically impossible to curate labeled datasets for all tasks, modalities, and outcomes for training supervised models. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies for training generalist medical AI models without the need for large-scale labeled datasets. In this talk, I will talk about how our group plan to develop generalist medical imaging models by combining multimodal fusion techniques with self-supervised learning.

  title: Assignment Control Plots - A Visual Companion for Causal Inference Study Design
  abstract:  An important step for any causal inference study design is understanding the distribution of the treated and untreated subjects in terms of measured baseline covariates.  However, not all baseline variation is equally important.  In the observational context, balancing on baseline variation summarized in a propensity score can help reduce bias due to self-selection. In both observational and experimental studies, controlling baseline variation associated with the expected outcomes can help increase the precision of causal effect estimates. We propose a set of visualizations that decompose the space of measured covariates into the different types of baseline variation important to the study design.  These assignment-control plots and variations thereof visually illustrate core concepts of causal inference and suggest new directions for methodological research on study design. As a practical demonstration, we illustrate one application of assignment-control plots to a study of cardiothoracic surgery. While the family of visualization tools for studies of causality is relatively sparse, simple visual tools can be an asset to education, application, and methods development.

  title: Adversarial debiasing with partial learning - medical image case-studies
  abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has become a very active research area in the last few years. While significant progress has been made in image classification tasks, only a few AI methods are actually being deployed in hospitals. A major hurdle in actively using clinical AI models currently is the trustworthiness of these models. When scrutinized, these models reveal implicit biases during the decision making, such as detecting race, ethnic groups, and subpopulations. These biases result in poor model performance, or racial disparity, for patients in these minority groups. In our ongoing study, we develop a two-step adversarial debiasing approach with partial learning that can reduce the racial disparity while preserving the performance of the targeted task. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on two independent medical image case-studies - chest X-ray and mammograms, and showed promises in reducing racial disparity while preserving the performance.

  abstract: Medical imaging is a critical step in modern healthcare procedures. Accurate interpretation of medical images, e.g., CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and histology images, plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis, assessment, and therapy. While deep learning provides an avenue to deliver automated medical image analysis and reconstruction via data-driven representation learning, the success is largely attributed to the massive datasets with abundant annotations. However, collecting and labeling such large-scaled dataset is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. In this talk, I will present our recent works on building data-efficient learning systems for medical image analysis and reconstruction, such as computer-aided diagnosis, anatomical structure segmentation, and CT reconstruction. The proposed methods cover a wide range of deep learning and machine learning topics, including semi-supervised learning, multi-modality learning, multi-task learning, integrating domain knowledge, etc. The up-to-date progress and promising future directions will also be discussed.

  title: Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Medical Image Synthesis, Translation, and Augmentation
  abstract: Medical imaging is a source of crucial information in modern healthcare. Deep learning models have been developed for various modalities such as CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and PET for automatic or semi-automatic diagnosis or assessment of diseases. While deep learning models have been proven to be very powerful, training such models sufficiently requires large, well-annotated but expensive datasets. However, medical images, especially those containing diseases, are rare. While there are a variety of solutions to improve models with limited and imbalanced datasets, one solution is generating these rare images through generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this presentation, I will present a quick review on the use of GANs in medical imaging tasks, specifically classification and segmentation. Then I will present and discuss our recent work on using GANs for generating synthetic dual energy CT (sDECT) from single energy CT (SECT). Finally, some interesting challenges and possible future directions of GANs in medical imaging will be discussed.

  title: Towards Unsupervised Biomedical Image Segmentation using Hyperbolic Representations
  abstract: Segmentation models are extremely useful for biomedical image analysis, but training segmentation models often require large, labelled datasets that are difficult and costly to acquire. Unsupervised learning is a promising approach for training segmentation models that avoids the need to acquire labelled datasets, but is made difficult by the lack of high-quality supervisory signal from expert annotations. Using the observation that biomedical images often contain an inherent hierarchical structure, we augment a VAE with additional supervisory signal via a novel self-supervised hierarchical loss. To aid the learning of hierarchical structure, we learn hyperbolic representations instead of Euclidean representations. Hyperbolic representations have previously been employed in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) as a way to learn hierarchical and tree-like structures, making them a natural choice of representation. In this talk, I will discuss hyperbolic representations for biomedical imaging as well as our recent paper on the topic.

  title: SegFormer - Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers
  abstract: We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features- 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code is available <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer">here</a>.

  title: Optimizing for Interpretability in Deep Neural Networks
  abstract: Deep models have advanced prediction in many domains, but their lack of interpretability remains a key barrier to their adoption in many real world applications. There exists a large body of work aiming to help humans understand these black box functions to varying levels of granularity – for example, through distillation, gradients, or adversarial examples. These methods however, all tackle interpretability as a separate process after training. In this talk, we explore a different approach and explicitly regularize deep models so that they are well-approximated by processes that humans can step through in little time. Applications will focus on medical prediction tasks for patients in critical care and with HIV.

  title: Weakly supervised tumor detection in whole slide image analysis
  abstract: Histopathology is one of the essential tools for disease assessment. In modern histopathology, whole slide imaging (WSI) has become a powerful and widely used tool to visualize tissue sections in disease diagnosis, medical education, and pathological research. The use of machine learning brings great opportunities to the automatic analysis of WSIs that could facilitate the pathologists’ workflow and more importantly, enable higher-order or large-scale correlations that are normally very challenging in standard histopathology practices, such as differential diagnosis of hard-cases and treatment response predictions. This talk will cover our recent work of approaching the fundamental problem of weakly supervised classification and tumor localization in gigapixel WSIs with a novel multiple instance learning (MIL) model leveraged by self-supervised learning, as well as discussing the emerging challenges and opportunities in computational histopathology.

  title: Federated Hyperparameter Tuning - Challenges, Baselines, and Connections to Weight-Sharing
  abstract: Tuning hyperparameters is a crucial but arduous part of the machine learning pipeline. Hyperparameter optimization is even more challenging in federated learning, where models are learned over a distributed network of heterogeneous devices; here, the need to keep data on device and perform local training makes it difficult to efficiently train and evaluate configurations. In this work, we investigate the problem of federated hyperparameter tuning. We first identify key challenges and show how standard approaches may be adapted to form baselines for the federated setting. Then, by making a novel connection to the neural architecture search technique of weight-sharing, we introduce a new method, FedEx, to accelerate federated hyperparameter tuning that is applicable to widely-used federated optimization methods such as FedAvg and recent variants. Theoretically, we show that a FedEx variant correctly tunes the on-device learning rate in the setting of online convex optimization across devices. Empirically, we show that FedEx can outperform natural baselines for federated hyperparameter tuning by several percentage points on the Shakespeare, FEMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks, obtaining higher accuracy using the same training budget.

  title: Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces
  abstract: A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies.  Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps.  This talk introduces the Structured State Space sequence model (S4), a simple new model based on the fundamental state space representation $x*(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$. S4 combines elegant properties of state space models with the recent HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization, resulting in a class of structured models that handles long-range dependencies mathematically and can be computed very efficiently.  S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, particularly for continuous signal data such as images, audio, and time series.

  title: Domain Adaptation with Invariant Representation Learning - What Transformations to Learn?
  abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation, as a prevalent transfer learning setting, spans many real-world applications. With the increasing representational power and applicability of neural networks, state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods make use of deep architectures to map the input features X to a latent representation Z that has the same marginal distribution across domains. This has been shown to be insufficient for generating optimal representation for classification, and to find conditionally invariant representations, usually strong assumptions are needed. We provide reasoning why when the supports of the source and target data from overlap, any map of X that is fixed across domains may not be suitable for domain adaptation via invariant features. Furthermore, we develop an efficient technique in which the optimal map from X to Z also takes domain-specific information as input, in addition to the features X. By using the property of minimal changes of causal mechanisms across domains, our model also takes into account the domain-specific information to ensure that the latent representation Z does not discard valuable information about Y . We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via synthetic and real-world data experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSAN.

  title: Facilitating the Curation and Future Analysis of Annotated Medical Images Across Institutions
  abstract: Medical imaging plays a significant role in different clinical applications such as detection, monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluations of various clinical conditions. Supervised deep learning approaches have been popular in solving medical image related tasks. However, training such models often require large amounts of annotated data as supervision, which is often unavailable in the medical area. Therefore, curation of annotated data is promising to create a large-scale dataset and contribute to the development of supervised learning. Nonetheless, directly sharing data is prohibited due to the patient concerns. Without exchanging data between internal and external data sources, we propose to apply unsupervised anomaly detectors on the internal dataset and learn the clean in-distribution (ID). Then we share the trained models with the externals and detect the class-wise shift data (aka. out-of-distribution (OOD) data) with the anomaly detectors. Higher anomaly scores indicate more difference the external data owe. We also suggest the quantification methods to measure the shiftness of detected data and the external dataset quality after removing the shift samples. Furthermore, we design a corresponding content-based medical image retrieval method that can balance both the intra- and inter-class variance for OOD-sensitive retrieval. The designed shift data identification pipeline can be used to help detect noisy and under-represented data automatically, accelerating the curation process. Meanwhile, the OOD-aware image retrieval is suitable for image annotation, querying and future analysis in external datasets.

  title: Incorporating domain knowledge in deep generative models for weakly supervised clustering with applications to survival data
  abstract: The ever-growing amount of data and the time cost associated with its labeling have made clustering a relevant task in machine learning. Yet, in many cases, a fully unsupervised clustering algorithm might naturally find a solution that is not consistent with the domain knowledge. Additionally, practitioners often have access to prior information about the types of clusters that are sought, and a principled method to guide the algorithm towards a desirable configuration is then needed. This talk will explore how to integrate domain knowledge, in the form of pairwise constraints and survival data, in deep generative models. Leveraging side information in biomedical datasets enables exploratory analysis of complex data types, resulting in medically meaningful findings.

The remaining challenges and promising future research directions will also be discussed.

  title: Exposing Shortcomings and Improving the Reliability of Machine Learning Explanations
  abstract: For domain experts to adopt machine learning (ML) models in high-stakes settings such as health care and law, they must understand and trust model predictions. As a result, researchers have proposed numerous ways to explain the predictions of complex ML models. However, these approaches suffer from several critical drawbacks, such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, instability, inconsistency, and lack of guidance about accuracy and correctness. For practitioners to safely use explanations in the real world, it is vital to properly characterize the limitations of current techniques and develop improved explainability methods. This talk will describe the shortcomings of explanations and introduce current research demonstrating how they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. I will also discuss promising solutions and present recent work on explanations that leverage uncertainty estimates to overcome several critical explanation shortcomings.

  title: Real-Time Seizure Detection using EEG - A Comprehensive Comparison of Recent Approaches under a Realistic Setting
  abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important diagnostic test that physicians use to record brain activity and detect seizures by monitoring the signals. There have been several attempts to detect seizures and abnormalities in EEG signals with modern deep learning models to reduce the clinical burden. However, they cannot be fairly compared against each other as they were tested in distinct experimental settings. Also, some of them are not trained in real-time seizure detection tasks, making it hard for on-device applications. In this work, for the first time, we extensively compare multiple state-of-the-art models and signal feature extractors in a real-time seizure detection framework suitable for real-world application, using various evaluation metrics including a new one we propose to evaluate more practical aspects of seizure detection models.

  title: Large Images as Long Documents - Rethinking Representation Learning in Gigapixel Pathology Images using Transformers
  abstract: Tissue phenotyping is a fundamental problem in computational pathology (CPATH) that aims at characterizing objective, histopathologic features within gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and the estimation of response-to-treatment in patients. However, unlike natural images, whole-slide imaging is a challenging computer vision domain as images can be as large as 150K x 150K pixels, which may be intractable for tasks such as survival prediction which entail modeling complex interactions between morphological visual concepts within the tumor microenvironment. In this talk, we present recent advances that rethink whole-slide images as long documents, adapting Transformer attention for- 1) early-based multimodal fusion with other modalities such as genomics, 2) learning hierarchical representations that capture cells, tissue patterns, and their spatial organization in the tumor microenvironment. In equipping conventional set-based deep learning frameworks in computational pathology with Transformer attention, we present- 1) new improvements on a variety of baselines on slide-level cancer subtyping and survival prediction, 2) new insights on how to perform self-supervision on high-resolution images, and 3) new tasks that shift the evaluation of slide-level tasks in CPATH from the conventional weakly-supervised regime (pixel annotations not needed) to an unsupervised regime (slide annotations not needed).

In his Ph.D., Richard is currently working on novel computer vision techniques for processing gigapixel images in computational pathology, in particular, 1) representation learning of the the tumor microenvironment,  2) integrative and interpretable techniques for discovering feature correspondences between histology and genomics, and 3) rethinking deep learning approaches for WSIs via advances in NLP - with the analogy that tissue patches in a gigapixel pathology image are words in a document.

  title: FlashAttention - Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness
  abstract: Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines- 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities- the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).

This research area of multimodal machine learning studies the computational and theoretical foundations of learning from heterogeneous data sources. This talk studies two core challenges in multimodal learning- (1) constructing multimodal models and datasets that enable generalization across many modalities and different tasks, and (2) designing quantification methods to comprehensively understand the internal mechanics of multimodal representations and gain insights for safe real-world deployment. <br> In the first part, we study generalization in multimodal learning. Generalization is particularly beneficial when one modality has limited resources such as the lack of annotated data, noisy inputs, or unreliable labels, and presents a step towards processing many diverse and understudied modalities. To enable the study of generalization, we introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas. Using MultiBench, we study generalization with parallel modalities, as well as in non-parallel scenarios, where we are presented with many modalities, but each task is defined only over a small subset of them. <br> The second part studies quantification of multimodal models via MultiViz, our recent attempt at a framework to understand the internal modeling of multimodal information and cross-modal interactions. We conclude this talk by discussing how future work can leverage these ideas to drive progress towards more general, scalable, and explainable multimodal models.

  title: Leveraging Physics-Based Priors for Label-Efficient, Robust MRI Reconstruction
  abstract: Deep learning has enabled improved image quality and fast inference times for various inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. However, these models require access to large amounts of fully-sampled (labeled) data and are sensitive to clinically-pervasive distribution drifts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a family of consistency-based training strategies, which leverage physics-driven data augmentations and our domain knowledge of MRI physics to improve label efficiency and robustness to relevant distribution shifts. In this talk, we will discuss how two of these methods, Noise2Recon and VORTEX, can reduce the need for labeled data by over 10-fold and increase robustness to both physics-driven perturbations and variations in anatomy and MRI sequences & contrasts. We will also discuss how these techniques can simplify composing heterogenous augmentation and self-supervised methods into a unified framework.

  title: Fairness in representation learning - a study in evaluating and addressing fairness via subgroup disparities in deep metric learning
  abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) enables learning with less supervision through its emphasis on the similarity structure of representations. There has been much work on improving generalization of DML in settings like zero-shot retrieval, but little is known about its implications for fairness. In this talk, we will discuss evaluation of state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data, and show the negative impact these representations have on minority subgroup performance when used for downstream tasks. In the talk, we will first define fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation space -- inter-class alignment, intra-class alignment, and uniformity -- and propose finDML, the fairness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce performance gaps between subgroups in both embedding space and downstream metrics. In addition to covering salient aspects of fairness in deep metric learning, the talk will encompass a larger discussion of fairness metrics in representation learning at large, where our proposed definitions exist within representation learning, and how use of such metrics may vary based on domain.

  title: Language Models Are An Effective Representation Learning Technique For Electronic Health Record Data
  abstract: The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has fueled the development of using machine learning to build prediction models for various clinical outcomes. However, this process is often constrained by having a relatively small number of patient records for training the model. We demonstrate that using patient representation schemes inspired from techniques in natural language processing can increase the accuracy of clinical prediction models by transferring information learned from the entire patient population to the task of training a specific model, where only a subset of the population is relevant. Such patient representation schemes enable a 3.5% mean improvement in AUROC on five prediction tasks compared to standard baselines, with the average improvement rising to 19% when only a small number of patient records are available for training the clinical prediction model. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420302653?via%3Dihub">Paper Linked Here</a>

  title: Opportunistic Incidence Prediction of Multiple Chronic Diseases from Abdominal CT Imaging Using Multi-Task Learning
  abstract: Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis is a paradigm where CT scans that have already been acquired for routine clinical questions are reanalyzed for disease prognostication, typically aided by machine learning. While such techniques for opportunistic use of abdominal CT scans have been implemented for assessing the risk of a handful of individual disorders, their prognostic power in simultaneously assessing multiple chronic disorders has not yet been evaluated. In this retrospective study of 9,154 patients, we demonstrate that we can effectively assess 5-year incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and osteoporosis (OST) using single already-acquired abdominal CT scans. We demonstrate that a shared multi-planar CT input, consisting of an axial CT slice occurring at the L3 vertebral level, as well as carefully selected sagittal and coronal slices, enables accurate future disease incidence prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that casting this shared CT input into a multi-task approach is particularly valuable in the low-label regime. With just 10% of labels for our diseases of interest, we recover nearly 99% of fully supervised AUROC performance, representing an improvement over single-task learning.

  title: Adapting Pretrained Vision-Language Foundational Models to Medical Imaging Domains
  abstract: Multi-modal foundation models are typically trained on millions of pairs of natural images and text captions. Although such models depict excellent generative capabilities, they do not typically generalize well to specific domains such as medical images that have fundamentally shifted distributions compared to natural images. Building generative models for medical images that faithfully depict clinical context may help alleviate the paucity of healthcare datasets. To investigate the capacity of a large pretrained latent diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) to generate medical domain-specific images, we explored the main components of the Stable Diffusion pipeline (the variational autoencoder, the U-Net and the text-encoder), to fine-tune the model to generate chest x-rays and evaluate the results on quantitative and qualitative levels. Our best-performing model can be text-conditioned to insert realistic-looking abnormalities like pleural effusions on synthetic radiological images, while maintaining a high accuracy on a classifier trained to detect the abnormality on real images.

He has been involved at the AIMI center for the last two years, where he developed NLP methods for domain-specific applications to radiology as well as multimodal tasks along vision models. As part of the MIDRC initiative, he worked on classification tasks in the data- and compute-constraint settings, as well as a text de-identification tool useful for the broad sharing of medical notes within and between institutions. More recently, he tackled both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, leading to models that can generate synthetic radiology images and reports, hopefully further useful to other machine learning applications in radiology.

  title: Benchmarking saliency methods for chest X-ray interpretation
  abstract: Saliency methods, which produce heat maps that highlight the areas of the medical image that influence model prediction, are often presented to clinicians as an aid in diagnostic decision-making. However, rigorous investigation of the accuracy and reliability of these strategies is necessary before they are integrated into the clinical setting. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate seven saliency methods, including Grad-CAM, across multiple neural network architectures using two evaluation metrics. We establish the first human benchmark for chest X-ray segmentation in a multilabel classification set-up, and examine under what clinical conditions saliency maps might be more prone to failure in localizing important pathologies compared with a human expert benchmark. We find that (1) while Grad-CAM generally localized pathologies better than the other evaluated saliency methods, all seven performed significantly worse compared with the human benchmark, (2) the gap in localization performance between Grad-CAM and the human benchmark was largest for pathologies that were smaller in size and had shapes that were more complex, and (3) model confidence was positively correlated with Grad-CAM localization performance. Our work demonstrates that several important limitations of saliency methods must be addressed before we can rely on them for deep learning explainability in medical imaging.

  title: Adaptation of Surgical Activity Recognition Models Across Operating Rooms
  abstract: Automatic surgical activity recognition enables more intelligent surgical devices and a more efficient workflow. Integration of such technology in new operating rooms has the potential to improve care delivery to patients and decrease costs. Recent works have achieved a promising performance on surgical activity recognition; however, the lack of generalizability of these models is one of the critical barriers to the wide-scale adoption of this technology. In this work, we study the generalizability of surgical activity recognition models across operating rooms. We propose a new domain adaptation method to improve the performance of the surgical activity recognition model in a new operating room for which we only have unlabeled videos. Our approach generates pseudo labels for unlabeled video clips that it is confident about and trains the model on the augmented version of the clips. We extend our method to a semi-supervised domain adaptation setting where a small portion of the target domain is also labeled. In our experiments, our proposed method consistently outperforms the baselines on a dataset of more than 480 long surgical videos collected from two operating rooms.

  title: Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment for Generalized Medical Visual Representation Learning
  abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired radiology reports has become an emerging topic in representation learning. However, existing medical image-text joint learning methods are limited by instance or local supervision analysis, ignoring disease-level semantic correspondences. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework for generalized medical visual representation learning by harnessing the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and radiology reports at three different levels, i.e., pathological region-level, instance-level, and disease-level. Specifically, we first incorporate the instance-wise alignment module by maximizing the agreement between image-report pairs. Further, for token-wise alignment, we introduce a bidirectional cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them. More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic (e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level alignment paradigm to enforce the cross-modal cluster assignment consistency. Extensive experimental results on seven downstream medical image datasets covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the stable and superior performance of our framework.

  title: Diagnosing failures of fairness transfer across distribution shift in real-world medical settings
  abstract: Diagnosing and mitigating changes in model fairness under distribution shift is an important component of the safe deployment of machine learning in healthcare settings. Importantly, the success of any mitigation strategy strongly depends on the \textit{structure} of the shift. Despite this, there has been little discussion of how to empirically assess the structure of a distribution shift that one is encountering in practice. In this work, we adopt a causal framing to motivate conditional independence tests as a key tool for characterizing distribution shifts. Using our approach in two medical applications, we show that this knowledge can help diagnose failures of fairness transfer, including cases where real-world shifts are more complex than is often assumed in the literature. Based on these results, we discuss potential remedies at each step of the machine learning pipeline.

  title: Denoising diffusion models for denoising diffusion MRI
  abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common and life-saving medical imaging technique. However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. In this work, we present Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM^2), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain.

  title: A Comparative Effectiveness Study on Opioid Use Disorder Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence and Existing Risk Models
  abstract: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading cause of death in the United States placing a tremendous burden on patients, their families, and health care systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed with available healthcare data to produce automated OUD prediction tools. In this retrospective study, we developed AI based models for OUD prediction and showed that AI can predict OUD more effectively than existing clinical tools including the unweighted opioid risk tool (ORT). On 100 randomly selected test sets including 47,396 patients, our proposed transformer-based AI model can predict OUD more efficiently (AUC=0.742±0.021) compared to logistic regression (AUC=0.651±0.025), random forest (AUC=0.679±0.026), xgboost (AUC=0.690±0.027), long short-term memory model (AUC=0.706±0.026), transformer (AUC=0.725±0.024), and unweighted ORT model (AUC=0.559±0.025). Our results show that embedding AI algorithms into clinical care may assist clinicians in risk stratification and management of patients receiving opioid.

  title: Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge
  abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of models today, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.

  title: Empowering Biomedical Informatics with Open Resources - Unleashing the Potential of Data and Tools
  abstract: Biomedical informatics is a highly interdisciplinary field that has gained increasing importance in recent years. Combining computer science, statistics, and information science with clinical and basic biomedical research, it seeks to leverage data-driven approaches to solve healthcare challenges and accelerate biomedical discovery. With the explosion of biomedical data generated from various sources such as genomic sequencing, medical imaging, electronic health records, and wearable devices, the field has witnessed significant growth in recent years. One of the key drivers of this growth is the increasing availability of open resources, such as open-access data repositories and software tools. These resources have democratized access to biomedical data and tools, making it easier for researchers to conduct biomedical informatics research and drive scientific discoveries. <br>PubMed, an open-access bibliographic database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), offers researchers access to millions of citations for biomedical literature, including links to full-text articles and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms for indexing and searching. These resources can be used to develop and validate computational models and algorithms, enabling researchers to study different aspects of diseases and therapies. Wikidata, a free and open knowledge graph maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation, is another critical open resource that is driving biomedical informatics.

  abstract: "Unstructured data (e.g. images, videos, text documents, etc.) are ubiquitous in today's digital world. However, the analysis of such data using traditional data science tools can be quite challenging. Foundation models (FMs) have shown that they extract semantically meaningful information from diverse types of unstructured data, but they can be imprecise, brittle, and difficult to control. We’re excited to introduce Meerkat, a Python library that teams can use to interactively wrangle their unstructured data with foundation models. In this talk, we will explore how Meerkat makes it easier to work with unstructured data and FMs, learn how to build user interfaces with Meerkat, and dive into potential applications in healthcare. <br>Interested in building with Meerkat?

  title: Multimodal learning with graphs for biomedical applications
  abstract: Artificial intelligence for graphs has achieved remarkable success in modelling complex systems, ranging from dynamic networks in biology to interacting particle systems in physics. However, the increasingly heterogeneous graph datasets call for multimodal methods that can combine different inductive biases — assumptions that algorithms use to make predictions for inputs they have not encountered during training. Learning on multimodal datasets is challenging because the inductive biases can vary by data modality and graphs might not be explicitly given in the input. To address these challenges, graph artificial intelligence methods combine different modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies through geometric relationships. Diverse datasets are combined using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal architectures, specified as image-intensive, knowledge-grounded and language-intensive models. Using this categorization, we introduce a blueprint for multimodal graph learning, use it to study existing methods and provide guidelines to design new models. This talk will focus on biomedical applications of multimodal graph learning, emphasizing how this blueprint can enable future innovation in this space.

  title: Leveraging Heterogeneity in Time-to-Event (Survival) Predictions
  abstract: "Time-to-Event Regression, often referred to as Survival Analysis or Censored Regression involves learning of statistical estimators of the survival distribution of an individual given their covariates. As opposed to standard regression, survival analysis is challenging as it involves accounting for outcomes censored due to loss of follow up. This circumstance is common in, e.g., bio-statistics, predictive maintenance, and econometrics. With the recent advances in machine learning methodology, especially deep learning, it is now possible to exploit expressive representations to help model survival outcomes. My thesis contributes to this new body of work by demonstrating that problems in survival analysis often manifest inherent heterogeneity which can be effectively discovered, characterized, and modeled to learn better estimators of survival.<br><br>Heterogeneity may arise in a multitude of settings in the context of survival analysis. Some examples include heterogeneity in the form of input features or covariates (for instance, static vs. streaming, time-varying data), or multiple outcomes of simultaneous interest (more commonly referred to as competing risks). Other sources of heterogeneity involve latent subgroups that manifest different base survival rates or differential responses to an intervention or treatment. In this talk, I aim to demonstrate that carefully modelling the inherent structure of heterogeneity can boost predictive power of survival analysis models while improving their specificity and precision of estimated survival at an individual level. An overarching methodological framework of this thesis is the application of graphical models to impose inherent structure in time-to-event problems that explicitly model heterogeneity, while employing advances in deep learning to learn powerful representations of data that help leverage various aspects of heterogeneity."

  abstract: "Despite recent progress in the field of medical artificial intelligence (AI), most existing models are narrow, single-task systems that require large quantities of labeled data to train. Moreover, these models cannot be easily reused in new clinical contexts and lack expressivity and interactive capabilities. This, in turn, has prevented their broad uptake in real-world healthcare settings. The advent of foundation models offers an opportunity to rethink medical AI and make it more performant, interactive, safer, and equitable. In this talk, I will share some of my recent work in the space of foundation medical models: REMEDIS, Co-Doc and Med-PaLM. In particular, I will highlight the effectiveness of these models in solving key medical AI translation problems such as data-efficient generalization, reliability and safety.

  title: Avoiding Model Aging by Continually Editing and Repairing Deployed Models
  abstract: "Deployed machine learning models often fail in unexpected ways. For example, models can perpetuate unexpected biases and rely on spurious features in their training data. Such performance decay can also happen gradually over time. While there is a wealth of work training models to be robust to shifting label and covariate distributions, a new paradigm is arising: updatable machine learning, where we adapt, edit, or repair big pre-trained models. With the advent of foundation models, such methods pose a cost-effective alternative to expensive retraining, especially when pre-training data are private or proprietary. This is particularly relevant in healthcare where training data are often private and models decay quickly. In this talk, I will discuss model editing, a paradigm for spot-fixing mistakes made by pre-trained models. I will then showcase my recent work introducing GRACE, the first method for continually editing pre-trained models thousands of times during deployment. GRACE learns to cache discrete segments of a language model's latent space, rerouting its embeddings to selectively modify the model's behavior and enabling targeted fixes in its predictions. These fixes leave the model's original weights unaltered and can generalize to correct new errors. I will conclude my talk with a look towards the future of lifelong model maintenance."

  title: "Why did the Model Fail? Attributing Model Performance Changes to Distribution Shifts"
  abstract: "Clinical machine learning models frequently experience performance drops under distribution shifts. These shifts may occur when a model is deployed in a different domain, a different subpopulation, or gradually over time. The underlying cause of such shifts may be multiple simultaneous factors such as changes in data quality, differences in specific covariate distributions, or changes in the relationship between label and features. When a model does fail during deployment, attributing model failure to these factors is critical for the model developer to identify the root cause and take mitigating action. In this talk, I will motivate the performance attribution problem, and present our recent method for attributing model performance changes to distribution shifts in the underlying data generating mechanism. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define the value of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only that set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions. The contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then quantified as its Shapley value. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of our method on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world case studies, showing its effectiveness in attributing performance changes to a wide range of distribution shifts."

  title: Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models
  abstract: "Multivariate biosignals play an important role in many medical domains, such as electroencephalography, polysomnography, and electrocardiography. Modeling multivariate biosignals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between the electrodes. In this talk, I will present a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture, GraphS4mer, which aims to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, (1) we leverage the Structured State Space architecture, a state-of-the-art deep sequence model, to capture long-range temporal dependencies in biosignals and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data. We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks and show that GraphS4mer consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalographic signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pre-training by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnographic signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) 12-lead electrocardiogram classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 2.7 points in macro-F1 score."

Development of DL models to improve breast cancer screening requires robustly curated and demographically diverse datasets to ensure generalizability. However, most publicly released breast cancer datasets are ethnically and racially homogeneous, are relatively small, and lack image annotations and/or pathologic data. While many mammographic datasets are available, they either lack semantic imaging descriptors (OMI-DB) or are not full-field digital mammograms (CBIS-DDSM) along with the underrepresentation of minority patients. As such, we created the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED) contains lesion-level annotations, pathologic outcomes, and demographic information for 116 000 patients from racially diverse backgrounds and will help bridge the existing gaps in granularity, diversity, and scale in breast imaging datasets."

  abstract: "In order to provide the most optimal medical care, doctors are advised to align their clinical treatments with the results of well-conducted clinical trials, or the aggregated results of multiple such trials. However, the overall estimated treatment effect is often an average of heterogeneous treatment effects and, as such, may not be applicable to most patient subgroups, let alone individual patients. A patient’s baseline risk—her or his probability of experiencing an outcome of interest—is an important determinant of treatment effect and can be used to guide medical decisions.

Performance of these methods is evaluated using simulations and real-world data."

  title: "Distilling Step-by-Step! Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes"
  abstract: "Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging because they are memory inefficient and compute-intensive for practical applications. In reaction, researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning and distillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparable performance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that (a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so by leveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for training small models within a multi-task framework. We present three findings across 4 NLP benchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to few-shot prompted LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both the model size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our finetuned 770M T5 model outperforms the few-shot prompted 540B PaLM model using only 80% of available data on a benchmark, whereas standard finetuning the same T5 model struggles to match even by using 100% of the dataset."

  abstract: "Existing vision-text contrastive learning like CLIP aims to match the paired image and caption embeddings while pushing others apart, which improves representation transferability and supports zero-shot prediction. However, medical image-text datasets are orders of magnitude below the general images and captions from the internet. Moreover, previous methods encounter many false negatives, i.e., images and reports from separate patients probably carry the same semantics but are wrongly treated as negatives. In this paper, we decouple images and texts for multimodal contrastive learning thus scaling the usable training data in a combinatorial magnitude with low cost. We also propose to replace the InfoNCE loss with semantic matching loss based on medical knowledge to eliminate false negatives in contrastive learning. We prove that MedCLIP is a simple yet effective framework: it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot prediction, supervised classification, and image-text retrieval. Surprisingly, we observe that with only 20K pre-training data, MedCLIP wins over the state-of-the-art method (using around 200K data)."

  abstract: "Language Models (LMs) can significantly impact the medical field by transforming textual information into usable data and addressing the shift from general language to medical language. The unique word distribution and sensitive data handling required in medical texts present distinct challenges and opportunities. Pretrained, domain specific models, such as BERT, can performs well in tasks such as extraction of procedures and ICD codes and the generation of text embeddings for downstream applications, despite its lack of conversational ability and the need for fine-tuning. Conversational medical Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a range of benefits, including accessibility, task versatility, data privacy, and educational utility. Still, they can also face issues such as hallucinations, insufficient data, errors in the data, and narrow instructions, limiting their current applicability. LMs can also take on a notable role in structuring data, particularly in the field of radiology. GPT-4 demonstrates potential for structured reporting, by converting complex free text reports into structured formats. However, limitations exist, such as the inability to use information not present in the text, potential for incorrect data entry, and privacy concerns. Understanding these aspects can contribute to a more nuanced perspective on the potential of LMs in medicine and the considerations necessary for their successful implementation."

Medical images are inherently different from natural images as they are acquired in the form of many modalities (CT, MR, PET, Ultrasound etc.) and contain granulated information like tissue, lesion, organs etc. These characteristics of medical images require special attention towards learning features representative of local context. In this work, we focus on designing an effective pre-training framework for 3D radiology images. First, we propose a new masking strategy called local masking where the masking is performed across channel embeddings instead of tokens to improve the learning of local feature representations. We combine this with classical low-level perturbations like adding noise and downsampling to further enable low-level representation learning. To this end, we introduce Disruptive Autoencoders, a pre-training framework that attempts to reconstruct the original image from disruptions created by a combination of local masking and low-level perturbations. Additionally, we also devise a cross-modal contrastive loss (CMCL) to accommodate the pre-training of multiple modalities in a single framework. We curate a large-scale dataset to enable pre-training of 3D medical radiology images (MRI and CT). The proposed pre-training framework is tested across multiple downstream tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our proposed method tops the public test leaderboard of BTCV multi-organ segmentation challenge."

  title: "Generative Diffusion Models for Medical Imaging"
  abstract: "Foundational generative models are gaining more and more interest in recent days. Among them, all the modalities except language seem to be converging towards a single class of model: diffusion models. In this talk, we will focus on leveraging diffusion models as generative priors using Bayesian inference, and how to use them to solve inverse problems, especially focusing on medical imaging. The talk will be focused on fully leveraging the power of foundation models by using them as plug-and-play building blocks to solve challenging downstream tasks. At the end of the talk, a new work on adapting diffusion models for out-of-distribution measurements, showcasing that diffusion models can be used to reconstruct data that were trained on completely different datasets.

  title: "Toward Universal Medical Image Segmentation: Challenges and Opportunities"
  abstract: "A major enduring focus of clinical workflows is disease analytics and diagnosis, leading to medical imaging datasets where the modalities and annotations are strongly tied to specific clinical objectives. To date, the prevailing training paradigm for medical image segmentation revolves around developing separate models for specific medical objects (e.g., organs or tumors) and image modalities (e.g., CT or MR). This traditional paradigm can hinder the robustness and generalizability of these AI models, inflate costs when further scaling data volumes, and fail to exploit potential synergies among various medical imaging tasks. By observing the training program of radiology residency, we recognize that radiologists’ expertise arises from routine exposure to a diverse range of medical images across body regions, diseases, and imaging modalities. This observation motivates us to explore a new training paradigm, 'universal medical image segmentation', whose key goal is to learn from diverse medical imaging sources. In this talk, I’ll delve into challenges in the new paradigm including issues with partial labeling, conflicting class definitions, and significant data heterogeneity. I’ll also present our pioneering solution, Hermes, aimed at tackling these challenges. We demonstrate that our proposed universal paradigm not only offers enhanced performance and scalability, but also excels in transfer learning, incremental learning and generalization. This innovative approach opens up new perspectives for the construction of foundational models in a broad range of medical image analysis."

  title: "Scalable Natural Language Processing for Transforming Medicine"
  abstract: "The data in electronic health records (EHRs) have immense potential to transform medicine both at the point-of-care and through retrospective research. However, structured data alone can only tell a fraction of patients' clinical narratives, as many clinically important variables are trapped within clinical notes. In this talk, I will discuss scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions to overcome these technical challenges in clinical information extraction. These include the development of label-efficient modeling methodology, novel techniques for leveraging large language models, and a new paradigm for EHR documentation that incentivizes the creation of high-quality data at the point-of-care."
